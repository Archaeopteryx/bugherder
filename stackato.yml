# Since we can't auto deploy a Stackato app in response to commits to the repo, we
# instead have to perform these gymnastics. We don't |stackato push| our source
# directory, since it will get stale (and we need the .git directory, which isn't
# ideal to upload). As such we |stackato push| only the Staticfile, and clone the
# repo as part of the deploy.
#
# Some other notes:
# * We are having to use the legacy stackato.yml syntax, since the Mozilla instance
#   is running an older v2.x Stackato release.
# * The cron that we use to update the repo only runs on instance #0, so we limit
#   the number of instances to one, since any others wouldn't self-update.
# * We set app-dir to be a subdirectory of the Bugherder repo, to ensure we only
#   upload 'Staticfile' and not the whole Bugherder repo.
# * The buildpack's staging step copies the project root to public/ in its entirety,
#   but we don't want .git to be served by nginx, so we delete it post staging.
# * The buildpack we're using auto-redirects http to https if FORCE_HTTPS is defined.
#
# To deploy this to Mozilla's Stackato instance, follow the generic client setup
# steps on Mana, and then |stackato push --no-prompt| from the root of the repo.
# However once it is deployed, it should need to further intervention, since it
# will auto-update from the Bugherder repo every 5 minutes, storing the status of
# the update at: <site>/deploy.txt
